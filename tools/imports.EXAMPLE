# The files in this directory provide a simple way to expose
# functions or entire modules to the AXL environment, making
# them accessible to excel. To use this, create a file called
# imports.<name>, where <name> would typically be the name of
# the package it is associated with, although it technically
# need only be unique. In this file, include one or more of
# the following standard Python import commands:
#
#    from <module> import *
#    from <module> import <sym1>, <sym2>, ... <symN>
#    import <module>
#
# Note that this is *not* parsed as pure Python, so only one
# of these three templates may be used. Comments are ignored.
# For example, the following line
#
# 	from pandas import DataFrame, Index   # ignore this comment
#
# makes symbols DataFrame and Index accessible from AXL.
#
# AXL does not permit imports to clash at the top level. That is,
# two different import.<name> files may not specify different
# objects to be imported into the same name. For instance
#
#   from foo import symbol_A
#   from bar import symbol_A
#
# and foo.symbol_A and bar.symbol_A do not point to the same object,
# an error will be raised.

from axl.methods import *
